# zig-es-sketch

Sketch of an incomplete, and in some places bugged, event sourcing system written Zig with an event store backed by SQLite3.

The event store is a port of an my unreleased Rust version. Unlike the rest of code, it has a what I consider to be a solid test suite. That said, the entire codebase should be considered unproven and unfit for production.
